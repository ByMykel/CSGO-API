And deliver he did, armed with only money, charm, and a way with words reserved for the world's most horrific cult leaders. Stunned by his lack of empathy for his fellow tourists and his ability to deliver a steady supply of 'ransom units' (people) the GW negotiated a position for Solman among them. Taking the highest percentage of hostage random money of any member of the GW, Solman had won the game before it even started.\\n\\n<i>You only need three things to fix a bad situation: money, charm, and a loaded weapon.</i>",
