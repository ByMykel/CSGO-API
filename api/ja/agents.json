        "description": "Disgraced heavyweight boxing champion, Arno The Overgrown was discovered by Guerrilla Warfare (GW) Trappers living out of a cave. Over the years Arno had become an expert survivalist and big-game hunter—able to live off the land for an indefinite amount of time carrying only his flint stick and sharpened hunting knife. Rumors of Arno eventually spread to nearby townships where he came to attention of Guerrilla Warfare (GW). Wanting to recruit Arno's flawless hunting and fighting skills, the GW failed to coax Arno from his habitat, that is, until they threatened to stop visiting him with hot fresh Milk Tarts every month. \\n\\n<i>It isn't the loneliness that kills you, it's the absence of Melk Tarts.</i>",
